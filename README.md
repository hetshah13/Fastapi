## Bank Note Authentication Using FastAPI

This project demonstrates a Bank Note Authentication system using FastAPI and a machine learning model to classify banknotes as genuine or counterfeit based on their characteristics.

### Dataset
The dataset used for training the machine learning model consists of various characteristics of banknotes such as:

Variance of the wavelet-transformed image.
Skewness of the wavelet-transformed image.
Curtosis of the wavelet-transformed image.
Entropy of the image.
These features are fed into a classification model to predict whether the banknote is real or fake.
