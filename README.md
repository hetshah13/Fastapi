## Bank Note Authentication Using FastAPI

This project demonstrates a Bank Note Authentication system using FastAPI and a machine learning model to classify banknotes as genuine or counterfeit based on their characteristics.

### Dataset
The dataset used for training the machine learning model consists of various characteristics of banknotes such as:

1. Variance of the wavelet-transformed image.
2. Skewness of the wavelet-transformed image.
3. Curtosis of the wavelet-transformed image.
4. Entropy of the image.

These features are fed into a classification model to predict whether the banknote is real or fake.
